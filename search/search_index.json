ID number / Social security number Iceland uses a national ID system called kennitala. It's a single ID number that's used for tax, insurance, car registration, bank transfers, receipts and much more. It's essential to apply for a kennitala as soon as you arrive as it's used for just about everything that involves ID. Your kennitala is a 10 digit number where the first six numbers are your date of birth in the format DDMMYYY. Kennitalas are public and don't contain any secret information (apart from your data of birth). Companies also have kennitalas. Tip If you are staying less than three months and are a national of the EU/EEA you can quickly obtain a 3-month temporary kennitala by submitting an A-263 form to Skatturinn (the tax authority). They will then get you a temporary kennitala in a few days. EU/EEA \u00b6 It\u2019s relatively simple for residents of the EU/EEA to acquire a kennitala. Warning As of 2020, individuals can no longer apply for a kennitala directly with \u00dej\u00f3\u00f0skr\u00e1 (the national register). If you have a job in Iceland, ask your employer to apply for one through Skatturinn (local tax authorities). If you intend to stay more than three months you need to prove your EU/EEA residency after filing digitally an A-271 form. ). Source: Skr\u00e1.is Before arriving in Iceland submit an A-271 . When you arrive, visit the nearest police station to present your idenfication and documents (passport), referencing the application number. The kennitala will be sent to you via email when a valid applicant is processed.

The address is queried dynamically and will not be found if you don\u2019t include correct Icelandic alphabet letters such as \u00f0, \u00fe or \u00f6. You may want to get this information emailed to you and copy-paste from there. Outside EU/EEU \u00b6 Tip The EU/EEA trade zone includes European Union nations, as well as EFTA member states: Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland. This means we are not officially in the European Union, although between the nations there is freedom to travel, work, ship goods and trade. For people with a legal residence outside the EU/EEA trade zone, getting legal residence and work status in Iceland will require an employer to vouch for you and get you on the expert knowledge program. See the Working in Iceland guide . For others it is still possible to get a permanent Kerfiskennitala (translation: System ID) and a bank account. Step 1 \u00b6 Contact a bank via their email or chat on their website (not by going in to the branch, that will just confuse the poor customer service rep). You should explain the following: \u201cI would like to open a bank account, but I don\u2019t yet have a kennitala. Can you confirm via email that I will need a kennitala to open a bank account at your bank?\u201d They will reply that of course you do. Save that email in PDF form. Step 2 \u00b6 Fill out this form and sign it (you can use the digital signature built into Preview on OS X, or similar digitized signature feature). In the field for \u201cReason for Application, put \u201cOpen a bank account\u201d. Create a single PDF that has: The A-275 form (filled out and signed) A copy of the email from the bank A copy of the first page of your passport Step 3 \u00b6 Email the PDF to kennitolur@skra.is . They will generally take 3-4 days to respond. Step 4 \u00b6 It will take another 3-4 days after they email you the System ID Kennitala for it to actually be in the National Registry.

Reference: reykjavik.is Note There is currently no official map of postal codes. This was taken from a post on DV.is which references a borken link on Posturinn.is. As you can see from these maps, neighborhoods don\u2019t map cleanly to postal codes. Nevertheless the neighboorhoods are frequently referred to by their primary postal codes. Famously the domestic flights airport is located very centrally, spoiling valuable land that would otherwise help reduce the need for long travel. Its area has recently been given the 102 postcode. The future of this area has been a source of political contention, but very likely the airport will gradually make way for a future central neighbourhood with mixed housing. History \u00b6 Since the war period the capital area has sprawled out with a car centric plan, especially in surrounding municipalities. Only in the last 10 years or so have the regional plans called for more walkable patterns and mixed housing areas. The result is that only Vesturb\u00e6r, Mi\u00f0borg, Hl\u00ed\u00f0ar, Laugardalur and some parts of Laugardalur are actually walkable and bike friendly. Mi\u00f0b\u00e6r (a.k.a. Downtown, 101 postcode) \u00b6 This is the downtown area and \u201eold town\u201c. This is where service, cafes, clubs and restaurants are clustered. This is by far the most touristy area with a density of high hotel and tourist accommodation. On friday and saturday nights young Icelanders travel from all over the Capital Region to party in the clubs in and around Laugavegur/Bankastr\u00e6ti.

Vesturb\u00e6r (107 postcode, with parts of 101) \u00b6 Has semi-walkable parts, the KR sports club and charming family housing. Not many offices.

For knowledge experts it\u2019s quite possible, and for anyone else it\u2019s a long and difficult process. EU/EEA Trade agreements \u00b6 Anyone with citizenship within the EU/EEA area is allowed to relocate freely and work in Iceland without any special license or work permit. For anyone outside this area it becomes much more complicated. Expert knowledge workers \u00b6 When companies require expert knowledge workers that are hard to find in Iceland and other EEA countries, they may contract an expert and acquire a temporary work permit on their behalf. Many companies are unaware of the tax benefits available to expert foreigners moving to Iceland. The tax benefits are for the worker, so it's up to the employee to submit the application. More information on work.iceland.is/hiring-a-foreign-expert . Worker's rights and legalities \u00b6 On paper and when enforced, worker\u2019s rights in Iceland are strong. However, many Icelandic companies do not respect worker\u2019s rights. All workers earn 24 working days of summer holiday every year. They have additional sick leave rights and cannot be asked to work an excessive amount of hours. They are entitled to appropriate clothing and security at their workplace. Look to Efling immediately if you are a non-desk worker and suspect your rights are not being observed. Here is a list of all unions ordered alphabetically. Minimum wage and legal stuff \u00b6 The main legal contracts surrounding employment are Collective Bargaining Agreements (is. Kjarasamningar) and then the individual agreements between employee and employer. There are no laws that mandate minimum wages or minimum benefits. They are governed through the collective agreements of labor unions and employer groups. Unions \u00b6 In many cases, employees are legally required to be part of a union, or at the minimum, pay into a union. Knowledge workers and experts usually have more control over this and can choose between unions. Unions are either for government and private market workers, and then within those two main categories, they're divided into groups and unions based on type of work and education. Although their main role is to negotiate salaries and other terms for work, unions offer their members all sorts of benefits, depending on the union. Benefits often include reimbursements for medical costs, legal assistance and summer house rentals at a low price. Unions also assist their members with issues relating to salaries, working conditions and such. Examples of unions are VR, Efling, BHM and Starfsgreinasambandi\u00f0. A list of all unions can be found here . Pension funds & voluntary supplementary pension \u00b6 The pension system in Iceland is semi-privatised. This means that the pension funds are independent funds, but paying into them is mandatory. Employees pay between 15% and 16% of their salaries into pension funds: 4% is deducted from the salary, and 11.5% 1 rest is paid by employer (on top of salary). The biggest part of the Icelandic labor market is bound to certain pension funds by collective agreements, but for ~40% of workers, they have a choice to pick their pension fund. Information on the pension fund employees are members of should, by law, be stated in the employment contract. 2 Employees have the option of contributing to supplemental, voluntary, pension. These are similar to 401k's in the US. Up to 4% is deducted from an employees salary before tax and deposited in a pension account, and the employer is required to match up to 2% (hence a 2% salary increase). There's a host of management companies to choose from, including all the pension funds and banks. In recent years, the government has leveraged the extra pension in creative ways, for example by allowing first time home buyers to directly deposit their extra pension into their mortgage. The additional pension can be withdrawn from the age of 60 years. Note While employees are only allowed to deposit up to 4% of their salary in extra pension, employers can pay more towards the extra pension. If you're negotiating salary (and foresee that you'd like this extra pension) you can always ask for a higher percentage paid by the employer into extra pension.
